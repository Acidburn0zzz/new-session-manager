## 2021-01-15 1.5.0
WARNING: Next scheduled release (2021-04-15) will switch the default session dir to an XDG Path.
With the next release prepare to either
1) Move old sessions to the new root directory (preferred)
2) Symlink "~/NSM Sessions" to the new root directory
3) use the nsmd --session-root commandline argument.

nsmd:
 Command line option --quiet: Suppress messages except warnings and errors
 Protect against orphaned clients or daemons when the server, or even a GUI, crashes.
 Replace cowboy-slang in info-level OSC with descriptive, technical messages.

Legacy-GUI:
 Fix manpage description and usage with the correct executable name
 Fix resizing to very small and back. ( / TheGreatWhiteShark )

 Various small fixes.

 Fixed reply for listing sessions from a plain "Done." to proper reply path with empty string as terminal symbol  "/reply", "/nsm/server/list", ""
 Fix operation reply to last treated client instead to reply to sender (Picot, Mathieu  / houston)
 /nsm/gui/session/name send consistent session name/relative-path pair to the annouced GUI, no matter how the session was loaded.
