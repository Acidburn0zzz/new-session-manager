Legacy-GUI:
 Overhaul look and feel.
 Rewrite labels and buttons with unambiguous descriptions.
 Protect text-input dialog windows from empty strings, like "Add New Client" or "New Session"

 Show all icons and buttons when attaching to a running nsmd session
 Various small fixes.

nsmd:
 NSM_API_VERSION_MINOR from 0 to 1 (1.0 -> 1.1)
 Repair nsmd to correctly send client data when running headless and a GUI announces later.
 ClientId generation now prevent collision with existing IDs.
 nsmd command line option --load-session to directly load one (Berkelder, Rik)
 Better detection of clients that failed to launch leads to faster session startup (by 5 seconds)
 Users get informed by client-label if an executable is not present on the system or permission denied
 Fixed reply for listing sessions from a plain "Done." to proper reply path with empty string as terminal symbol  "/reply", "/nsm/server/list", ""
 Fix operation reply to last treated client instead to reply to sender (Picot, Mathieu  / houston)

nsm.h
 :optional-gui: support to nsm.h, for other applications to include and use. (Meyer, Hermann / brummer )
